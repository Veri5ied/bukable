# Bukable Assessment

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

## Tool Used

- React
- SASS
- GitHub API
- React Paginate
- React Icons

## Challenges

The GitHub API returns an error for no user found instead of returning an empty object or array, so that section of the app is not handled but other functionalities are working.
